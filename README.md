<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Octavio Eduardo Villal√≥n</h1>
<h3 align="center">Full Stack Developer from Argentina</h3>

---

I currently lead five teams at ATRIX: Development, Testing, Technical Support, Infrastructure, and Functional Analysis. Throughout my career, I‚Äôve combined a strong technical foundation with a passion for management, taking on roles such as Product Owner, Scrum Master, Tech Lead, and Project Manager simultaneously.

I drive continuous improvement through metrics, agile methodologies, and close team leadership. I have led strategic projects like Consuman Evolution from inception to execution, and helped professionalize areas such as Technical Support and Testing by implementing ticketing systems, performance metrics, and agile practices.

I'm passionate about challenges that require technical vision, end-to-end management, and the leadership of multidisciplinary teams. I'm currently focusing my career on project and team management, while staying grounded in my development background.

üìç Open to new challenges where I can contribute my experience in management, technical leadership, and digital transformation.
